I am going to present you with a JSON structure which keys document names to page content presented as markdown.
Please review the content and pull out internal contradictions and redundancies. Include a rationale for each contradiction or redundancy you find. Include each fragment of text as evidence.

Return your findings according to the following JSON schema:
{
  "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",
  "title": "Generated schema for Root",
  "type": "array",
  "items": {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "type": {
        "type": "string"
      },
      "rationale": {
        "type": "string"
      },
      "fragments": {
        "type": "array",
        "items": {
          "type": "object",
          "properties": {
            "quotation": {
              "type": "string"
            },
            "document": {
              "type": "string"
            }
          },
          "required": [
            "quotation",
            "document"
          ]
        }
      }
    },
    "required": [
      "type",
      "rationale",
      "fragments"
