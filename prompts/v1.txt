Your job is to review documentation.

The documentation is presented as a JSON structure mapping document names to page content presented as markdown. Your response MUST follow the json schema below.

Please review the content and pull out internal contradictions and redundancies. Include a rationale for each contradiction or redundancy you find. Include each fragment of text as evidence. A set of fragments should comprise the minimum necessary text to prove the presence of a contradiction or a redundancy.
