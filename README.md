# üñçÔ∏è crit

audit your docs

## What is it and who is it for?

crit is a tool for auditing GOV.UK Tech Docs style technical documentation websites.

It helps technical writers and content designers identify internal contradictions in the documentation.

It might be useful for cleaning up corpuses for RAG.

## How does it work?

crit 

- scrapes websites built using the [tech docs template](https://github.com/alphagov/tech-docs-template)
- chunks the documents
- uses an LLM to compare each chunk with every other chunk, producing a list of contradictory statements

## How do I use it?

```
poetry install
```

### Scrape

```
poetry run python -m crit.extract https://docs.whatever.service.gov.uk/ #¬†or another tech docs site
```

This will output the timestamped filename of a JSON file containing the contents of the website, e.g. `docs.whatever.service.gov.uk/content-12345.json`

### Compare

```
poetry run python -m crit.compare docs.whatever.service.gov.uk/content-12345.json
```

This will output the name of an HTML file.

To view the file it's recommended to run a web server in `public/`

```
cd public
python -m http.server
```

Then visit `http://localhost:8000` and your output reports will be listed.

## Roadmap

Auditing 100 chunks pairwise results in (100**2 + 100) / 2 = 5050 comparisons. This is time-consuming and expensive.

Other approaches should be considered. For example:

- using semantic search to identify the top k chunks likeliest to overlap with a given chunk, and only comparing those ones
- stuffing the context window with more chunks (current approach goes chunk by chunk with a heavy fixed cost of repeating the whole prompt for each comparison
- running inference in parallel so it takes less time
