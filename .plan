given a text
use tiktoken to break it into chunks: 512 tokens per chunk, with overlap 20
assign each chunk an id and create a JSON which maps ids to chunks
prepare chunks for comparison: set up a generator for pairs of chunks where each chunk is compared with the others exactly once (i.e. compare AB but not BA) and also with itself.
send each pair to an LLM (leave a placeholder here, I'll provide this part)
the LLM will return a JSON structure. write each JSON structure into a list.
Once the list is complete, reduce it in the following way: the JSON structure will include keys for "chunk1" and "chunk2" as well as an object under "findings". transform the list into a structure keyed on fragment
Iterate over the list of 
Once all comparisons are completed
for each chunk comparison, return a JSON 
at each juncture
